# Smart Power Logger [WIP]
- This project is a USB-C power logging board built around the INA219 current/voltage sensor. It measures the voltage, current, and power draw of any device connected to a USB-C, then makes that data available for analysis through a microcontroller interface.

## Overview
- Additionally, this project includes an onboard voltage regulator, and a header for microcontroller connection.
- Started this project out of personal interest. Collaborated with a friend so we could both build our individual and teamwork skills together.
- Utilized KiCad, and ESP32.

## Features
- Logs power usage from USB-C using INA219 sensor

## Results
[WIP]

## Skills Demonstrated
- PCB design
- Circuit analysis
- Microcontroller programming
- Data visualization
